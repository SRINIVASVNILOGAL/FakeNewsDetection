Built an NLP-based text classification system using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression to detect fake vs real news articles.

Extended the system to classify AI-generated vs Human-written news, addressing a modern challenge in content authenticity.

Applied LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to explain model predictions, highlighting keywords (e.g., “aliens”, “ufo” for fake news or “transformative”, “paradigm” for AI-generated content) that influenced decisions.

Achieved 94% accuracy in fake vs real classification and 89% accuracy in AI vs human detection.

Outcome: Delivered an explainable AI system that improves trust, interpretability, and robustness in misinformation and AI-content detection.
